This pipeline can call SNPs from given reads . SNP's or single nuclotide polymorphisms  is a germline substitution of a single nucleotide at a specific position in the genome. 
Underlying biology and problem description: We are living in the post-genomic era where sequencing genomes now takes under a day; thousands of genomes have  been  sequenced  and  assembled.  Many  (not  all)  organisms,  whether prokaryote  or  eukaryote,  now  have  a  complete  reference  (or  a  canonical) genome sequenced and assembled already. Given that assembling genomes de novo requires substantial expertise along with computational and human resources,  a  more  practical  approach  of  analyzing  genomes  is  to  map  the genomic reads to an existing reference. This approach is also referred to as genome re-sequencing.
Input command line options:
Option Meaning
-a     Input reads file – pair 1
-b     Input reads file – pair 2
-r     Reference genome file
-e     Perform read re-alignment
-o     Output VCF file name
-f     Mills file location
-z     Output VCF file should be gunzipped (*.vcf.gz)
-v     Verbose mode; print each instruction/command to tell the user what your script is doing right now
-i     Index your output BAM file (using samtools index)
-h     Print usage information (how to run your script and the arguments it takes in) and exit(MANUAL)
